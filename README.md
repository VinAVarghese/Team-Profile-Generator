  This Node CLI application prompts the user to enter in general information about their software team. After entering the desired amount of team memebers and information relevant to their role (as a manager, engineer or intern) the user can choose to print and have an html page rendered. The final render delievers a beautifully responsive html page summarizing the team and each member's information for easy reference.
